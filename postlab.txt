PostLab Questions: Week 6

1. Describe the large-scale differences between the mapped reads from species 1 and species 2, and explain what this mapping tells us about the relative genome structure of the two genomes that we mapped. If we compared this genomic region in a dot plot, what would it look like? Describe at least one biological mechanism by which this may have occurred.




2. Do you see evidence of misassemblies? If so, describe where you see evidence for this and what this evidence looks like.




3. Do you see any evidence of single nucleotide polymorphisms? If so, describe where you see evidence for this and what this evidence looks like.
